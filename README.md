I built a web-based e-commerce application for an Apple Store using a full-stack approach. 
The project is a complete online shopping platform where users can browse Apple products like iPhones, iPads, Macs, AirPods, and accessories, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python with Flask framework for server-side logic and routing
Database: MySQL for storing product inventory, cart items, and purchase history
Frontend: HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsive design, JavaScript for interactive features
Database Integration: MySQL Connector for Python to handle database operations

Key Features:

Product catalog display with inventory management
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products
Shopping cart functionality with quantity tracking
Purchase system that automatically reduces inventory
Purchase history tracking
Responsive web design that works on desktop and mobile

The application demonstrates full-stack web development skills, database design, user interface development, and real-world e-commerce functionality.
It's a practical project that combines multiple technologies to create a working online store.
